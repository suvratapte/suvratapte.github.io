KG Westman and I recorded this exciting new album a few weeks back and now it is out!

It contains a long presentation of raga Anandpriya (created by KG Westman) - Alaap, Jod, Jhala, Gat in Vilambit Teentaal and Gat in Drut Ektaal.

It also contains a shorter presentation of raga Kirwai - Alaap, Jod, Jhala and a Gat in Rupak.
