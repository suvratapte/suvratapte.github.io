Thanks for visiting my website! My name is Suvrat. I am a software engineer at <a href="https://www.helpshift.com/" target="_blank">Helpshift Inc</a>.

I write distributed systems in Clojure. I like to dive deep into whatever I learn. I have spoken at Functional Conf 2019 about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/suvratapte/debuggers-in-lispy-languages" target="_blank">Debuggers in Lisps</a>.

Before moving to backend programming, I was an iOS developer for 2 years at Helpshift itself where I wrote Objective-C and Swift. I have spoken about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/suvratapte/objective-c-internals" target="_blank">Objective-C Internals</a>.

I'm an Emacs devotee and I like to <a href="https://medium.com/@suvratapte/configuring-emacs-from-scratch-intro-3157bed9d040" target="_blank">write</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su6RTAN_8tA" target="_blank">talk</a> about Emacs. My Emacs config sits <a href="https://github.com/suvratapte/dot-emacs-dot-d" target="_blank">here</a>.

I'm very much interested in understanding how operating systems work. Here are my notes on the operating systems classic <a href="https://github.com/suvratapte/Maurice-Bach-Notes" target="_blank">The Design of the UNIX Opearting System</a> by Maurice J. Bach.

Other than tech, I'm deeply interested in Indian Classical music and music in general. I have been playing tabla (an Indian percussion instrument) for past 15 years. These days, I have started learning sitar.
I have conducted workshops on music theory and I regularly teach tabla.

I run a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/suvratapte1" target="_blank" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> for curated technical tabla content.

I hope to share my learnings about tech (and maybe about music) on this website.

See you around! ðŸ˜„
